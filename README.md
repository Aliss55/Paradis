# Paradis

This project is the website developed for the Prototype tool to support the initial stage of learning to write in the Spanish language.

## Documentation

Our website has different parts focusing on Spanish language learning. You'll find sections with info on how to use Spanish, fun games to practice what you've learned, and a special area where you can write short stories. These stories are then checked for grammar using natural language processing.

It's worth mentioning that the website was built using Angular and PrimeNG. These powerful tools helped in creating a user-friendly interface and interactive components for an enhanced learning experience.
